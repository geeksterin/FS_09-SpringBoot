This project is a basic web application that allows users to sign in, sign up, and manage their profile information. Additionally, users can create posts and view posts created by other users. The application uses authentication tokens to secure user data and ensure that only authenticated users can access certain features of the application.

## Framework Used
* Spring Boot

---
<br>

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

* Spring Boot Dev Tools
* Spring Web
* Spring Data JPA
* MySQL Driver
* Lombok
* Validation
* Swagger

<br>

## Database Configuration
To connect to a MySQL database, update the application.properties file with the appropriate database URL, username, and password. The following properties need to be updated:
```
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<DatabaseName>
spring.datasource.username = <userName>
spring.datasource.password = <password>
spring.jpa.show-sql = true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

```
<br>

## Language Used
* Java

---
<br>

## Data Model

The Job data model is defined in the Job class, which has the following attributes:
<br>

* User Model
```
Id : integer
firstName : string
lastName : string
age : integer
email : string
password : string
phoneNumber : string
```

* Post Model
```
postId = Long
createdDate : Timestamp
updatedDate : Timestamp
postData : String
@ManyToOne
user : User

```

* Authentication Token 
```
tokenId : Long
token : string
tokenCreationDate : LocalDate
@OneToOne 
user : User
```
## Data Flow

1. The user at client side sends a request to the application through the API endpoints.
2. The API receives the request and sends it to the appropriate controller method.
3. The controller method makes a call to the method in service class.
4. The method in service class builds logic and retrieves or modifies data from the database, which is in turn given to controller class
5. The controller method returns a response to the API.
6. The API sends the response back to the user.

DELETE /user/signout: authenticate a user and delete authentication token
```

* Post Controller
```
